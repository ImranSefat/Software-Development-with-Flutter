# Software Development with Flutter

### Thanks to IEEE IUT Student Branch for giving me the chance to take a 3 days long workshop. There were around 300 students from different universities as the workshop was open for all. One thing to note is that there was a large number of students from different backgrounds such as EEE, College level students, etc. 

### The attendees learned beginner to advanced topics like UI designing, Data modeling, API integration, Routes, etc. 

#### The attendees worked with NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Open APIs to make a flutter app that shows astronomical data in their flutter application. 

#### Special thanks to Towhidul Tonmoy and Ahmad Jarif Yeasir for managing my requests.

## Documentation
## Day 1
#### Introduction to Flutter and Design Analysis
Nowadays Mobile users expect their apps to have a beautiful design, smooth animations, and grand performance to deliver on. Developers need to create a new feature faster than ever without compromising on quality or performance. That’s why Google built flutter. Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively
compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. In the first session, the attendees will able to understand the basis of Flutter App Development, Installation of the IDE and Flutter, Dart a programming language to develop a flutter app, the basis of a beautiful user-friendly app, project structure breakdown to the simplest level, why designs are important, analysis of some UI designs, styling the app components, etc. 
##### Main Topics
- Basic introduction of flutter
- I thought Dart is just a game
- Why would you use it?
- IDEs, Extensions, hacks etc
- Widget, widget, and widget
- What is Hot reload?
- UI components
- Project structure breakdown

## Day 2
#### Complex User Interface Structures and State Change
The average US user spends 5 hours per day on mobile. The vast majority of that time is spent on apps and on websites. The difference between a good app and a bad app is usually the quality of its user experience (UX). A good UX is what separates successful apps from unsuccessful ones. Today, mobile users expect a lot from an app: fast loading time, ease of use, and delight during the interaction. If you want your app to be successful, you have to consider UX to be not just a minor aspect of design, but an essential component of product strategy. This session will guide the attendees to turn their app idea into a reality where they will learn how to
make an app with complex design, managing different screens, data models, managing and defining states, etc.
##### Main Topics
- Complex UI and UX designs
- App designing 101
- UI Design Analysis
- Styling Flutter Components
- Component Management
- Design to App
- State? What’s that?
- Basic day to day widgets

## Day 3 
#### Asynchronous App Development and API integration
API plays a huge role in software engineering. There is plenty of APIs that provides us with small data like today’s weather or large data like the whole world’s flight info or news from the New York Times etc. This session will teach what APIs are, why they are important in our day-to-day life, and how to work with them in our apps. The attendees will understand how to handle API calls, how to manage the state of the app when the data is loading, or received, or did not even load in their app. The attendees will work with an API which is
provided by NASA to make an app where each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

##### Main Topics
- API
- Asynchronous App Development
- Handling APIs
- Animations
- Creating the data model from scratch for the API
- Making the whole app from scratch using the created Data model
